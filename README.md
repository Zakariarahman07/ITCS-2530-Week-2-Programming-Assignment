## Math Aptitude Analyzer
### Description 
The Math Aptitude Analyzer is a simple C++ console program that asks the user about their math study habits and confidence level as their input. It calculates and displays the estimated number of math problems solved per hour, then writes the results in a formatted table to a text file called 'report.txt' (there is an example file of report.txt inside the repo).

###Features
1) Welcomes the user with a friendly banner
2) Collects User Input:
   * Full name
   * Favorite math subject
   * Number of math problems solved per week
   * Confidence level in math (1â€“10 scale)
   * Hours spent studying math per week
3) Performs calculations to estimate problems solved per hour
4) Validates input to handle invalid entries gracefully
5) Outputs results to a neatly formatted file ('report.txt')   

### How to Run the Program
1) Open your Visual Studio or VS Code on your computer
2) Make sure to have a C++ Compiler installed on your computer
3) Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory
4) Compile/Run the program
5) If you enter invalid data type for integer or double type, then you will see a default value for that variable. You can re-run/restart the program to enter correct data types for each variable.
